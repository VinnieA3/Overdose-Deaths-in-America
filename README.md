# From Tragedy to Insight: Overdose Deaths in America
This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model to predict the number of deaths per month due to drug overdose. The forecasting model will provide accurate predictions for all 50 of the United States, Washington D.C., and New York City.

## Stakeholder: Federal Government

The Federal Government is the main stakeholder in this project, as they will use the predictions generated by the time series forecasting model to inform policy decisions related to the allocation of resources to combat the disease. It is important that the model is accurate and reliable, as the decisions made based on its predictions could have significant impacts on public health and safety.

## Time Series Forecasting Overview

Time series modeling and forecasting is a statistical technique used to analyze data collected over time. Its main objective is to understand patterns and trends in the data to make future predictions. The process typically involves data collection, preprocessing, analysis, model selection, model training, model validation, and forecasting.

Data collection involves gathering data over regular or irregular intervals. Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the data by addressing missing values, outliers, and other quality issues. Time series analysis is used to identify patterns and trends in the data, while model selection involves choosing a model that best fits the data. Model training is used to estimate the parameters of the selected model using historical data, while model validation is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model by comparing predicted values to actual values.

Time series modeling and forecasting can be applied to various fields, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and sales forecasting. It is an essential tool for decision-making based on historical data and predicting future outcomes.
There are many methods for time series forecasting, but we will focus on two of the most commonly used ones: naive and ARIMA models.

### Naive Model
The naive model assumes that the future value of the time series is equal to the last observed value. This model is easy to implement and can serve as a baseline for more complex models.

### ARIMA Model
The ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a more sophisticated method that takes into account the autocorrelation and trend in the time series. This model has three parameters: p (order of autoregression), d (order of differencing), and q (order of moving average).

## Data Overview

This dataset provides provisional counts for drug overdose deaths in the United States based on the most current data available in the National Vital Statistics System. The data includes national-level counts as well as counts for individual jurisdictions, such as states and the District of Columbia. The counts are reported on a monthly basis and include both reported and predicted provisional counts.
The provisional data includes counts of reported and predicted provisional drug overdose deaths, percentage changes in drug overdose deaths for the current 12-month period compared to the same period in the previous year, and counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes. The counts represent the number of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the specified month, and are insensitive to seasonal variations.
However, it's important to note that provisional data are often incomplete and subject to reporting delays, which may result in underestimation of drug overdose deaths. To address this, methods have been developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating predicted provisional counts. The dataset also includes data quality metrics, such as percent completeness in overall death reporting and percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, to aid in the interpretation of the provisional data.
